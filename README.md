# Quizee
I created this app while learning and followed [CheezyCode](https://www.youtube.com/@CheezyCode). It allows users to participate in quizzes according to their taste or pick a particular date quiz. After attempting and submitting the quiz, scores and correct answers to the questions will be shown.

My main challenge in this project was working with firestore, as it is a NoSQL document database, and I had never worked with a NoSQL database. But with some good blogs &â€¯excellent documentation on the internet & with some dedication, I overcame challenges and completed it, and now I have some extra knowledge from yesterday.

* Cloud firestore to store & fetch data
* Navigation drawer
