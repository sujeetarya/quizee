# Quizee
Quizee is an app that allows the user to participate in quiz accorting to their taste or pick a particular date quize after attempting and submitting the quiz score and correct answers of the questions will be shown.

Main challenge for me in this project was working with firestore as it is a NoSQL document database and I never worked with NoSQL database but with some good blogs & great documentation on internet & some dedication I overcome challenges and completed the project and now I have some extra knowledge from yesterday.
